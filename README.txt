This folder contains input files needed to run example SE Tasmanian Atlantis ecosystem model.
For more details about the model see https://github.com/Atlantis-Ecosystem-Model/Atlantis_example_and_instructions

The example files provided here will run the simulation for 365 days. This takes about 1-2 minutes on a standard laptop computer.

######################
To run the SE Tasmanian example model on Windows:

1. Put the atlantis exectutable file (atlantismain.exe) and all .dll files that come with it into
the same folder as your input files.
2. Open the command terminal
3. Navigate to the folder that has atlantismain.exe, .dll files and input files. \
4. Type the name of the .bat file, in this case RunAtlantis.bat

######################
Note, Atlantis will start loading input files, and output a lot of warning messages.
Most of these warning messages just inform users about the spatial position of their functional groups, missing non-essential parameters
and other model aspects and can be ignored for now.

When all input files are loaded and checked and the actual simulations start Atlantis will start producing daily output like this:

t = 0.5, hd.t = 1.75, TofY: 0, % Done: 0.136986
t = 1, hd.t = 2.25, TofY: 1, % Done: 0.273973
t = 1.5, hd.t = 2.75, TofY: 1, % Done: 0.410959
...

When simulations end Atlantis will print:

t = 364, hd.t = 365.25, TofY: 364, % Done: 99.726027
t = 364.5, hd.t = 1.153843746e+032, TofY: 364, % Done: 99.863014
